# Magic Fifteen (Magic XV)

Magic Fifteen is a two-sided sliding piece puzzle, consisting of 17 tiles in a 5x5 square. The middle three columns have vertical sliders moving 4 tiles up and down. Horizontally again three sliders are in place, the top and bottom ones in the first and last row also moving 4 tiles and the middle slider, spanning three rows, moving 3x4 tiles left and right. The top horizontal slider will only move, if all vertical sliders are up and the bottom horizontal slider only moves, if all vertical sliders are down.

On the front side, 15 of 17 tiles are numbered in roman numbers 1-15, one has an asterisk and one is black. On the back side, the tiles are numbered in arabic numbers from 0-15, where 0 occurs twice.

The aim of the game is to solve the either the front side and bring all roman numbered tiles into a 4x4 square with the asterisk being on the bottom-right side, or to solve the back side, and arrange the numbers 1-9 in the 3x3 grid as a magic square.
